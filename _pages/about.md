About Me
======
Welcome to my website! As you can probably tell from the sidebar, my name is Bryan. As of the creation of this page, I am a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech who is currently taking ECE 3574. I hail from the far and distant lands of Northern Virginia, where I was born and raised.

This may come as a surprise, but the profile picture is not actually a photo of me. It's the Crimson Qin! It's a combination of the Crimson Chin from Nickelodeon TV Show The Fairly Odd Parents and Qin Shi Huang, the founder of the Qin Dynasty. I chose this profile picture because it tells people two things about me. First, that I am a goofy guy who usually doesn't take things seriously. Second, I like to keep my identity private. I don't particularly like putting my likeness out there on the internet if I don't need to.

Where's Everything Else?
======
I am well aware that my website is a bit.. bare at the moment. This is in part because this is a website made for a class, and also because I don't yet think I have anything worth sharing with the world. If that changes, you can expect me to edit the navigation bar and add tabs and links accordingly.
